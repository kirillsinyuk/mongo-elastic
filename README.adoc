MongoDb + Elasticsearch
------------------------

This is a pet project for the experimental usage of MongoDb as a primary
database and Elasticsearch as a search engine.

Why?
~~~

The main idea for this combination stems from the limited options for text search in MongoDb.

I faced this problem while working on one project.
All that MongoDb proposes in addition to classic indexes is one *TextIndex* on collection without any option to tune it.
It becomes a total mess when you need a multifield search with default sort by creationTime,
because MongoDb will have to find all results for every field, merge them, and sort.
So the more data you have, the longer it`ll take. I couldn`t find a way to optimize it.

How?
~~~

It brought me to the idea that I could use another database that was made for text search.
The main problem was how to sync the data between them.
And this is where https://rwynn.github.io/monstache-site/[Monstache^] takes action.
